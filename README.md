## Why did I create this device ? üòá
I have been djing with Ableton for 10 years now as I love the freedom to build my custom DJ setups without beeing limited by stock plugings. But compared to other djing software such as Serato, RecordBox or Tracktor beatmatching gets quite tricky with Ableton. It also isn¬¥t as easy to get a quick overview about the¬¥current status of important info as it is in other programms, as Abletons interface just offers to much. 
That is why I decided to invest the time to build this device, It is very much possible to make amazing mixes with Ableton without this device, but with it it is more fun! üòÑ

## How did I make this device? üßê

Programming in M4L was a fun experience. Tbh I thought it would be much simpler programming in a visual cooding environment compared to a script based one, but I had to struggle to keep an overview here and thereüòÖ. Here is how the two modules that make up the device look like:
